## Partial Proofs

> We are aware that proof assistants such as Isabelle provide a framework for defining partial functions that does not prevent users from proving properties about them. This kind of framework can be implemented in Lean 4. Actually, it can be implemented by users since Lean 4 is an extensible system. The developers current have no plans to implement this kind of support for Lean 4. However, we remark that users can implement it using a function that traverses the auxiliary unsafe definition generated by Lean, and produces a safe one using an approach similar to the one used in Isabelle.
